# Meetup-Planner-Django-Bytewise-Task-
A simple meetup planner made using django.

Welcome to the Meetup Planner Application repository!

This is a Django-based web application that enables users to organize and attend meetups at specific locations. The website has an attractive interface that provides a seamless experience for creating, managing, and joining meetups.

With this application, users can easily create new meetups, specify the location and time, and invite other users to join. They can also search for and join existing meetups that match their interests and schedule.

To use the application, you will need to have Django and other required dependencies installed. 

This project is an excellent example of a Django-based web application that demonstrates several core features of Django, including models, views, templates, and user authentication.
